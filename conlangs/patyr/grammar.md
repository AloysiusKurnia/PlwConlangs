# Patyr Language Grammar

This language is a nominative-accusative language. The word order is Subject-verb-object, noun-modifier (therefore this language uses postpositions).
Nouns and verbs are inflected in the same way, collectively called _formative_.

| Inflection | Purpose                                   | Singular | Plural |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Nominative | Acts as a subject noun of the sentence.   | -(e)     | -er    |
| Accusative | Acts as a direct object of the sentence.  | -in      | -irni  |
| Genitive   | Indicates to which the noun possesses to. | -a       | -ar    |

1.  For verbs, nominative/genitive inflection makes it non-finite. Accusative form lets it functions as a verb.
2.  For adjectives, the accusative commonly means 'be'
4.  For animals, the accusative depends on the animal but commonly means 'hunt' or 'farm'.
5.  For tools, the accusative commonly means 'use'.
6.  For other nouns, the accusative commonly means 'be'.
